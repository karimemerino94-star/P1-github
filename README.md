# Version Control with Git

This exercise documents the correct procedures for setting up a local development environment and synchronizing it with a remote repository on GitHub.

## Local Environment
The folder structure was managed directly from the system root directory to ensure optimal organization:

1. **Disk Access:** Navigating to the system root using cd c.

2. **Directory Creation:** The working directory was set to "develop".

3. **Navigation:** Entering the development directory using cd develop.

## Integration with GitHub
Once the local environment was set up, the exercise was linked to the cloud:

Use the command `git clone https://github.com/karimemerino94-star/P1-github.git`.

The successful download and access to the main branch of the project were then confirmed.

## Tools to Use
* **Git Bash:** This was the main terminal for executing commands.

* **Git:** This was the version control system.

* **Visual Studio Code:** This was the editor used to edit files and view the exercise.
